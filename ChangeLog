    * Add compatibility for Apache 2.2 and older versions of NSS.
      Tested on RHEL 6.5.
    * Replace some PR_Free calls with more correct PORT_Free.
    * Initialize session_tickets as FALSE instead of UNSET.
    * Modernize the autotools configuration, generate config.h
    * Get the version from config.h to get the proper mod_nss version
      for reporting at runtime. It previously displayed the version
      of Apache where the mod_nss version should have gone.

    * Initialize ciphers to all disabled before renegotiation
      (#1165408)

2014-11-06  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * Add support for enabling TLS v1.2
    * Don't enable SSL 3 by default (CVE-2014-3566)
    * Improve protocol testing

2014-02-20  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

2013-10-11  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Only clear the SSL Session Cache when shutting the server down.

2013-10-11  Matthew Harmsen <mharmsen@redhat.com>
    * Add support for TLS v1.1

2013-07-02  Matthew Harmsen <mharmsen@redhat.com>
    * Add man page for nss_pcache, update man page for gencert

2011-10-09  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Fix static array overrun when generating arg list for nss_pcache

2011-06-14  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Always copy in client certificate and fix FakeBasicAuth

    * When NSSOptions +FakeBasicAuth is set for a directory, and a
      certificate is not provided with which the BasicAuth can be Faked,
      and the client provides an Authorization header, the FakeBasicAuth
      code in mod_nss may not properly reject an attempt to spoof.

    * No need to shut things down if NSS isn't initialized.

2011-03-02  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Add semaphore lock around retrieving token PINs to avoid overruns.

2011-02-03  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Add man page for gencert

2011-01-12  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Don't use memcpy as it may operate on overlapping memory (#669118)
      Patch ported from mod_ssl by Stephen Gallagher <sgallagh@redhat.com>

2010-09-22  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Only call PK11_ListCerts once and pass it when configuring each
      virtual server. This saves considerable time when there are a lot
      of certificates and/or virtual servers. (#635324)
    * Change enforce so that we only check the validity of the certificate
      if enforcecerts is enabled (the default).
      Patch contributed by Wolter Eldering <wolter.eldering@vanad.com.cn>

2010-09-17  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Fix endless read loop in some situations when handling POST data
      (#620856)
      This was discovered in the dogtag TPS subsystem. I haven't been able
      to duplicate it outside of that but it is trivial inside. This seems
      to fix it and brings the code closer to what mod_ssl does here as well.

2010-05-14  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Ignore SIGHUP in nss_pcache (#591889). 
      Contributed by Joshua Roys <roysjosh@gmail.com>

2010-05-13  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Compare CN value of remote host with requested host in reverse proxy.
    * Add configuration option to disable this, defaulting to on. (#591224)
      Based on patch from Joshua Roys <roysjosh@gmail.com>

2010-03-22  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Update list of errors we translate

2010-03-02  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Add controls for managing SSL renegotiation
      NSS is introducing some new controls in response to CVE-2009-3555,
      MITM attacks via session renegotiation. This patch adds some tuning
      so these options can be set at run time.
      Patch contributed by Kai Engert <kengert@redhat.com>

2008-07-21  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * mod_nss 1.0.8

2008-07-02  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * Don't allow blank passwords if FIPS is enabled. This is not
      allowed by the NSS FIPS 140-2 security policy.

2008-05-16  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>
    * No need to link with softokn3
    * Fix FIPS mode
    * There seem to be a problem in NSS_Shutdown() that makes subsequent
      logins appear to succeed but they actually are skipped causing keys
      and certs to not be available.
    * Also switch an error message to a warning related to FIPS ciphers.

2008-05-09  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * NSS has been modified to not allow a fork after an NSS_Init() in the
      soft token. It apparently always did this for hardware tokens as it is
      part of the PKCS#11 spec.
    * This moves the initialization code into the child process init
      function.

2008-01-03  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * See if the certificate has a version before trying to decode it into
      a CGI variable.

2007-10-18  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * If mod_ssl isn't loaded then register the hooks to mod_proxy so we
      can do at least secure proxy in front of an unsecure host.

2007-06-07  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * The error message was wrong if NSSPassPhraseHelper pointed to a
      non-existant file.
    * Don't require a password file AND NSSPassPhraseHelper. Only
      the helper is required. 
       
2007-06-01  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * mod_nss 1.0.7
    * Stop processing tokens when a login fails so we can correctly
      report the failure.
    * Fix an off-by-one error in nss_pcache that prevented 1 character
      passwords (not a huge problem but a bug none-the-less).
    * Bring in some updates based on diffs from 2.0.59 to 2.2.4
        * Do explicit TRUE/FALSE tests with sc->enabled to see if SSL is
          enabled.
        * Don't depend on the fact that TRUE == 1
        * Remove some dead code
        * Minor update to the buffer code that buffers POST data during a
          renegotation
        * Optimize setting environment variables by using a switch statement.
    * Fix typo in cipher echde_rsa_null (transposed h and d).
    * The way I was using to detect the model being used was incorrect. Now
      use the # of threads available. Guaranteed to be 0 for prefork and > 0
      for worker (threaded)

2006-10-27  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * mod_nss 1.0.6
    * If NSSEngine is off then simply don't initialize NSS at all.
    * Add support for setting a default OCSP responder. 

2006-10-17  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * mod_nss 1.0.5
    * Fix for a minor problem introduced with 1.0.4. NSS_Shutdown() was being
      called during module unload even if SSL wasn't enabled causing an error
      to display in the log.

2006-10-11  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * mod_nss 1.0.4 
    * Merged in some changes from mod_ssl:
        * new env variables SSL_{SERVER,CLIENT}_V_REMAIN that contains number
          of days until certificate expires
        * Attempt to buffer POST data in a SSL renegotiation. 
    * And some changes specific to mod_nss:
        * Better way to distinguish Apache 2.0.x versus Apache 2.2.x. The old
          way broke when 2.0.56 was introduced.
        * Fix crash bug if the stored token password doesn't match the
          database password
        * Add new NSSPassPhraseDialog method, defer, where only the tokens
          that are found in the file pointed to by this directive are
          initialized.
        * Fix race condition in initializing the NSS session cache that could
          cause a core on startup.
        * Update nss.conf.in to contain LogLevel and its own log files
        * A missing initialization when built with ECC support that could
          cause the server to not start 

2006-06-21  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * mod_nss 1.0.3
    * Final ECC support
    * Compiles on Solaris with the Forte Workshop compiler (tested with 6.2
      and 11).
    * A number of compilation warnings were addressed
    * gencert now uses bash instead of ksh 

2006-03-02  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * Experimental Eliptical Curve Cryptopgraphy (ECC) added. Requires a
      version of NSS also build with ECC support. Available in the CVS tip. 

2006-01-31  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * mod_nss 1.0.2
    * Add support for Apache 2.2 (contributed by Oden Eriksson) 

2006-09-20  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * mod_nss 1.0.0
    * Support for SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1
    * OCSP and CRLs
    * Client certificate authentication
    * Can run concurrently with mod_ssl
