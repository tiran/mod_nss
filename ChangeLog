    * mod_nss 1.0.7
    * Stop processing tokens when a login fails so we can correctly
      report the failure.
    * Fix an off-by-one error in nss_pcache that prevented 1 character
      passwords (not a huge problem but a bug none-the-less).
    * Bring in some updates based on diffs from 2.0.59 to 2.2.4
        * Do explicit TRUE/FALSE tests with sc->enabled to see if SSL is
          enabled.
        * Don't depend on the fact that TRUE == 1
        * Remove some dead code
        * Minor update to the buffer code that buffers POST data during a
          renegotation
        * Optimize setting environment variables by using a switch statement.
    * Fix typo in cipher echde_rsa_null (transposed h and d).
    * The way I was using to detect the model being used was incorrect. Now
      use the # of threads available. Guaranteed to be 0 for prefork and > 0
      for worker (threaded)

    * mod_nss 1.0.6
    * If NSSEngine is off then simply don't initialize NSS at all.
    * Add support for setting a default OCSP responder.

    * mod_nss 1.0.5
    * Fix for a minor problem introduced with 1.0.4. NSS_Shutdown() was being
      called during module unload even if SSL wasn't enabled causing an error
      to display in the log.

    * mod_nss 1.0.4 
    * Merged in some changes from mod_ssl:
        * new env variables SSL_{SERVER,CLIENT}_V_REMAIN that contains number
          of days until certificate expires
        * Attempt to buffer POST data in a SSL renegotiation. 
    * And some changes specific to mod_nss:
        * Better way to distinguish Apache 2.0.x versus Apache 2.2.x. The old
          way broke when 2.0.56 was introduced.
        * Fix crash bug if the stored token password doesn't match the
          database password
        * Add new NSSPassPhraseDialog method, defer, where only the tokens
          that are found in the file pointed to by this directive are
          initialized.
        * Fix race condition in initializing the NSS session cache that could
          cause a core on startup.
        * Update nss.conf.in to contain LogLevel and its own log files
        * A missing initialization when built with ECC support that could
          cause the server to not start

    * mod_nss 1.0.3
    * Final ECC support
    * Compiles on Solaris with the Forte Workshop compiler (tested with 6.2
      and 11).
    * A number of compilation warnings were addressed
    * gencert now uses bash instead of ksh 

2006-03-02  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * Experimental Eliptical Curve Cryptopgraphy (ECC) added. Requires a
      version of NSS also build with ECC support. Available in the CVS tip. 

2006-01-31  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * mod_nss 1.0.2
    * Add support for Apache 2.2 (contributed by Oden Eriksson) 

2006-09-20  Rob Crittenden <rcritten@redhat.com>

    * mod_nss 1.0.0
    * Support for SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1
    * OCSP and CRLs
    * Client certificate authentication
    * Can run concurrently with mod_ssl
