SYNOPSIS

 This Apache module provides strong cryptography for the Apache 2.0 webserver
 via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS
 v1) protocols by the help of the SSL/TLS implementation library NSS

 This module is based heavily on the mod_ssl package. In fact, it's more
 a conversion than anything else.

BUILDING

 To build this you'll need NSPR 4.4.1 and NSS 3.9.3. It may work with earlier
 versions but these are recommended (or tested). These can be retrieved from
 http://www.mozilla.org/. The --with-nspr and --with-nss tags require that
 the package be installed in the same parent directory (e.g. /opt/nspr,
 /usr/local/nspr, etc). It will look in this parent for include/, lib/, etc.

 If --with-nss or --with-nspr are not passed configure will look for the
 mozilla-[nss|nspr]-devel packages and use the libraries with that if found.
 It is strongly recommended that the mozilla.org version be used instead.

 Build and install those packages somewhere then configure the module with
 something like:

 % ./configure --with-apxs=/path/to/apxs/ --with-nspr=/path/to/nspr/ --with-nss=/path/to/nss/
 % gmake all install

 This will install a sample configuration file nss.conf. You'll need to do
 some hand-editing as well.

 To httpd.conf add (anywhere is fine):

 Include conf/nss.conf

 You'll need to change the default ports in nss.conf from 443 to
 something else if you aren't starting this as root.

CONFIGURING

 You'll need to create an NSS database and get a server certificate installed.
 A script, gencerts, is included to help get things going with a self-signed
 certificate. This is a *BAD* idea and you shouldn't use this. It is for
 example purposes only.

 You can store the token passwords in a file so you aren't prompted during
 startup (so you can do unattended starts, for example). To do this, set
 the file that will store the token passwords in the NSSPassPhraseDialog 
 attribute in nss.conf ala:

 NSSPassPhraseDialog  file:/path/to/password.conf

 The format of the file for a non-hardware token is tokenname:password.
 A sample for the internal software token is like:

 internal:netscape
