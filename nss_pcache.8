.SH "NAME"
nss_pcache \- Helper program used to store token password pins

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
nss_pcache <semid> <fips on/off> <directory> [prefix]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A helper program used by the Apache \fBhttpd\fP mod_nss plug-in to store the NSS PKCS #11 token password pins between restarts of Apache.
.PP
Whenever an Apache \fBhttpd\fP process configured to use the mod_nss plug-in is started, this program will be automatically invoked via reference to the mod_nss configuration file stored under \fB/etc/httpd/conf.d/nss.conf\fP which contains the following default entry:
.IP
#   Pass Phrase Helper:
.br
#   This helper program stores the token password pins between
.br
#   restarts of Apache.
.br
NSSPassPhraseHelper /usr/sbin/nss_pcache
