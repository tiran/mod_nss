.SH "NAME"
gencert \- Generate a test NSS database for mod_nss
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
gencert \fIDIRECTORY\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A tool to generate self\-signed CA as well as server and user certificates for mod_nss testing.

This is used to generate a default NSS database for the mod_nss Apache module. It does not test to see if an existing database already exists so use with care.

gencert will generate a new NSS database and set an empty database password.

It generates a self\-signed CA with the subject "CN=Certificate Shack, O=example.com, C=US"

It also generates a certificate suitable for servers with the subject "CN=FQDN, O=example.com, C=US" and a user certificate with the subject "E=alpha@FQDN, CN=Frank Alpha, UID=alpha, OU=People, O=example.com, C=US".

The nicknames it uses are:

CA: cacert

Server certificate: Server\-Cert

User cert: alpha
